Tetra-Benzoyldatiscetin.

Baumanns metbod of- introducing benzoylgroups into hydroxy-
lated substances applied to datiscetin did not give satisfactory re—
sults. The reaction between datiscetin and benzoylchloride takes
however place very readily in the presence of pyridine.

5 g· of datiscetin were dissolved in 50 g of pyridine and to
this solution 123 g of benzoylchloride were added in small quan-
tities3 a rise of the temperature was stopped by cooling the vesel
with water. The originally brown solution turned gradually reddish
brown and pyridine hydrochloride was formed in large quantities.
After 24 hours standing at ordinary temperatum, the mixture was
poured into diluted sulphuric aeid and after the lapse of two days
the sediment produced filtered off⁷ washed with water and dryed
in a desicator. The benzoylation product was finally crystallized
several times from boiling diluted aceton. It represents white needles,
melting at 190-1910, difficultly solubly in acetic aeid, alcohol and
ether. The results of three analysis point to tetrabenzoyldatiscetin:

1) 01886 g gave 05078 g (30.Ξ and 00665 g H2O
2) 01799 „ „ o·4831 „ „ ⁷⁷ 0·063‹› n η
3) 01880 „ „ 0505& „ ῃ „ 0·0647 „ „

corresponding to:
1) 73·43⁰f'0 C and 3·940s0 H

2) 73·24⁰s· „ „ 391οχ. „

The formula (315 H6 Ο6 (CO C6 H5)4 requires:
C : 73 480s,
Η z 373 ⁰3³0.

It seems therefore quite certain that datiscetin contains four hy-
dfOXylgroups. It is isomeric with luteolin and fisetin and is pro-
bably a flavon or flavonol derivative. The investigation of its consti-
t“tion must be based on the study of its decomposition products
under the influence of alkalies at elevated temperatures. Up to now
the results obtained are however unsatisfactory3 we isolated only
Phenol and salicylic aeid and it is therefore for the present im-

POSSible to get a clear view of the constitution of datiscetin.
