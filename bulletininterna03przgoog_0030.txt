ties Jf urobilin are not sufficiently characteristic for the purpose
of identification. It was therefore necessary to seek for more exact
means of characterising the reduction product in question as well
as haemopyrroline‚ obtained from haemoglobin or chlorophyll deri-
vativeS. The search for such means proved successfu13 one of us
(L. M.) described ¹) with J. Hetper and H. Goldmann combination
products of haemopyrroline with diazonium compounds with suffi-
ciently characteristic properties. It remained now to investigate the
behaviour of the synthetical product, mentioned above towards dia-
zonium compounds. The present communication contains an account
of our results in this respect.

The methyl-n-propyl-maleic anhydride from which as stated we
started, was obtained according to Michael and Tissots method. The
crude reaction product containing methyl-n-propyl-malic acid was
distilled and divided by fractionation into the following fractions:
1., 117—14003 2., 140-171ος 3., 171-1900, 4., 190-2300, 4.,
230-245.

The four first fractions were united and the heavier portion se-
parated from the lighter one in a dividing funel and distilled again.
The following fractions were obtained: 1.‚ up to 210⁰, 2., 210-2350,
3., 235—2450. This third fraction was united with the fifth frac-
tion of the first series of distillations and distilled again3 the major
part distilled now at 239—2450, and after distilling it twice using
a Zincke thermometer a product was finally obtained distilling con-
stantly at 242—2430 under 734 mm pressure. Kflster and Haas ²)
found the boiling point of methyl-n-propyl-maleic anhydride at
241—2420. The refraction of this anhydride we found at 25⁰ =
1·46913‚ and its density di}⁵ = 108995, from which data the fol-
lowing molecular refraction is derived:

MR„ = M ΞΞΞ ἐς 3933

whereas theoretically the following value is obtained using the ato-
mic refractions as ascertained by Bruhl:

moos -Ι- 10310 -ι- 4574 -ι- 1-683 -ι- ι-τοτ = 38·482.
