acetic aeid and as soon as the mother liquor showed only a very
faint brownish tint, the crystallisation was carried on using dilute
alcohol and repeated as often as the product obtained still gave t-ra-
ees of alkyliodide in the apparatus of Zeisel. The final product re-
presented very pale yellow fine needles which melted very much
higher than the product studied by Schunck and one of us, namely
at 268—2690. In other respects it does not differ very much from
the substance studied formerly. It dissolves easily in caustic alka-
lies with a yellow colom, organic solvents take it up comparatively
easily. In cone. sulphuric aeid it dissolves with a pale yellow colour
and the solution shows a pale greenish fluorescenz. Fehlings solution
is not reduced by it, but its colour turns greenish, silvei· nitrate in
ammoniaca] solution is reduced by it at the boil.

The composition corresponds to the formula C,‚.,H,0O⁶ and not to
ΟιὸΗηΟὸ and the body may be identical with datiscetin isolated by
Stenhouse. Quite pure samples do not contain alkylox‘ygroups‘ whereas
the less thoroughly purified sainples dc, as stated above, contain them.
in one case we found as much as O·80s'0. The substance studied by
Schunck and one of us contained a large amount of alkyloxygroups
and this fact amongst others led at that time to the supposition
that the colouring principle of Datisca cannabina is a methoxyxan·
thonderivative. In the light. of our present researches the roots con·
tain at least two colouring matters in varying quatities, one melting
at 2370, and another melting at 266-2600 of the formuia omnmo&
which ought to be called in accordance with the proposal of Sten-
house datiscetin. In the samples at present at our disposal the al-
kyloxygroups containing body is undoubtedly also present, as proved
by the fact that not quite pure datiscetin samples yield small quan-
tities of alkyliodide when treated with hydroiodic acid. whether the
quantities of this alkylated substance in our present raw material
will be sufficiently large to enable its isolation we cannot say at
present3 we shall endeavour to get hold of it.
