Tetra-Acetyldatiseetin.

The attempt to convert datiscetin into an acetylderivative suc-
ceeded easily applying Liebermanns method. The solution containing
an excess of anhydrous acetic acid was treated first with a suffi-
cient amount of alcohol to decompose the former and poured into
a large quantity of water. A resinous mass remained undissolved
which after several days solidified into an amorphous brittle sub-
stance. The purification of the crude product was attained by se-
veral crystallisations from ether. Quite white needles were thus ob-
tained which melted at 138⁰. The analysis show that a tetracetyl-'
derivative was obtained.

The estimation of the acetylgroups contained in acetyldatiscetin
did not give satisfactory results on account of datiscetin being itself
attacked by the prolonged action of even comparatively dilute al-
kalieS. It was therefore desirable to get additional proofs for the
assumption that datiscetin contains four hydroxylgroups; to this end
we prepared the corresponding benzoylderivative.
