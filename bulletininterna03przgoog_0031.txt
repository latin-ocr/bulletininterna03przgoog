The agreement of the theoretical value with the experimentally
found one is not as good as could be desired and it is therefore quite
possible that despite the careful distillation a trace of some other
homologue of maleic anhydride remained admixed to the examined
product. These impurities cannot however amount to much, in fact
the merest traces may have the influence stated.

The conversion of the anhydride into the imide was carried out
in the manner described in our former communication. We got it
this time in the form of white needles melting exactly at 56⁰, by
crystallising the raw product from ligroin several times.

The reduction with zinc dust at high temperaturos in a current
of hydrogen took place rapidly and ,the fumes produced were
carried by the hydrogen current into a flask containing well coo-
led ether. The ethereal solution⁷ which was coloured slightly yellow
was next shaken for some time with an aqueous solution of ben—
zenediazoniumchloride. The colour of the ether turned at once red-
dish brown. The ethereal solution was next separated and treated
with a small quantity of conc. hydrochloric acid, the latter turned
bright cherry red, whereas the ether retained a brown colour; the
latter was poured ost' and replaced by new small quantities of ether
and shaken as long as it took up any of the· brown colouring mat—
ter. Next the solution in hydrochloric acid was diluted with water,
the acid neutralized by adding sodium hydrate and the colouring
matter taken up in ether. The ethereal solution. after washing it
repeatedly with small quantities of water in order to remove the
superflous alkali, was finally treated with a small quantity of di-
lute hydrochloric acid. The formerly bright red colour changed to
a more bluish shade and in the hope to get the azobody in the
crystallized state the acidulatcd ethei-eal solution was left to stand
for some time. No crystallisation however took place. After removing
the ether by evaporation a red mass remained which appeared greenish
in reflected light. It was dissolved in alcohnl, some sodium hydrate
and water added and the whole shaken up with ether. The ethereal
solution examined in the spectroscop revealed the haemopyrroline-
disawdibenzene spectrum, consisting of two bands placed in exactly
the same position as the hands of the disazo colouring matter na-
med. The acidulated ethereal solution showed a spectrum correspon-
ding exactly to the spectrum of haemopyrroline-disazo-dibenzene-

hydrochloride. ·
