which melted at 237⁰ and which might have possibly represented
a bioxy-bimethoxyxanthon. Resides this sample of roots we had
yet two others in much smaller quantities of unknown origin3 a tho-
rough examination of these smaller samples was impossible but we
had found in one of them a substance that differed materially from
the one mentioned before3 after being treated with acids it gave a
sugat which contrary to our expectations did ferment in the im-
pure state with ycast, viz. could not be identical with rhamnose.
Thanks to the kindness of J. H. Burckhill Esq. of the Indian Museum
of Calcutt·a we were in the position to examin samples of Datisca
Cannabina roots collected in the Punjab.

The roots were worked up in the following manner. They were
extracted with boiling alcohol and the extract evaporated to dryness,
The resinous mass obtained was next treated with boiling water
which dissolved a large portion of the residue leaving a brown re-
sinous mass undisolved3 this latter could be separated easily by de-
cantation from the aqueous solution. The aqueous solution gave
after some hours standing a yellowish white voluminous precipitate
which was filtercd off, washed with water and recrystallized once
more from boiling water. The crytals obtained were next dissolved
in a very small quantity of alcohol and a large quantity of ether
added. After 24 hours from this solution very pure crystals were
deposited, which after renewed crystallisation from boiling water
and drying in a desicator at ordinary temperature melted at 190⁰·
The melting point was not influenced by further crystallisationS.

The second mother liquor which was coloured more or less
strongly brownish was mixed with ether, which produced a white
precipitate. The latter purified in the manner described by crystal-
lizing from a mixture of alcohol and ether gave a white crystalli-
zed product identical with the former one. The substance isolated
represents undoubtedly a glucoside like body, which under the trc-
atment of hydrolizing agents splits up into a substance difficultly
soluble iu water and a sugar like body which will be examined
thoroughly later on.

Our attention was drawn first of all to the insoluble desinte-
gration product which possesses properties akin but not identical to
those shown by the product studied by one of us with Schunck.
The purification of this substance was carried out as follows:

The raw product was recrystallized several times from boiling
